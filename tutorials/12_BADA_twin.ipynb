    "\n",
    "Real-time data assimilation combines quick estimates of a physical state from an numerical model with experimental data.  In reality, numerical models are not a perfect representation of the physical quantity which we aim to predict because they typically rely on assumptions and simplifications for computational, i.e, they have an inherent model bias.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.1. The source of bias: model accuracy vs computational cost <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"source\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of physical model plays a key role in the assimilation. Numerical models are mathematical representations of the processes that govern the behaviour of a physical system. For example, in weather forecasting, models simulate how the atmosphere evolves over time based on physical equations describing fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, etc. The more physical information we add to the model, the higher the accuracy of the model estimates. However, the computational requirements increase with the model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform real-time data assimilation we need quick estimates of the physical system. Thus, performing real-time high-fidelity modelling is not plausible in realistic scenarios. In order to apply real-time data assimilation to low-fidelity models, we must provide an estimate of the bias in the numerical model, i.e., the model error that we introduce when simplifying the physical equations.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The model bias is defined as  is the expected difference between the true observable and the model observable. Therefore, it is unknown a priori (colloquially, it is an <em>unknown unknown</em>).  The model bias may be a function of the physical state, the environment or even a function of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent advances in machine learning for data-driven modelling allow us to develop surrogate models of dynamical systems using neural networks. This is, we can use a neural network to estimate the bias of the low-order numerical models. Specifically, we employ an echo state network (ESN) to infer the model bias.  ESNs are suitable for real-time data assimilation because \n",
    "1. they are recurrent neural networks, i.e., they are designed to learn temporal dynamics in data; \n",
    "2. they are based on reservoir computing, hence they are universal approximators;\n",
    "3. they are general nonlinear auto-regressive models (Aggarwal 2018); and \n",
    "4. training an ESN consists of solving a linear regression problem, which provides a global minimum without backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of the model bias estimation by ESN is illustrated below. The network can evolve in open-loop (left) when observations are available or in closed-loop (right), in which the ESN runs autonomously. \n",
